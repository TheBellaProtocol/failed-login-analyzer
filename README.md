# Failed Login Activity Analyzer

## Project Overview
This Python project analyzes failed login attempts to identify unusual activity. 
It calculates daily login totals, compares them to historical averages, and alerts 
when a user’s activity is unusually high. 

This project demonstrates entry-level skills in Python, security data analysis, 
and basic anomaly detection.

## Features
- Calculate and display current day logins and average logins per user
- Compute ratio of current activity to average activity
- Issue alert if login activity is unusually high

## Usage
1. Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/TheBellaProtocol/failed-login-analyzer.git
2. Run the script:
python analyze_logins.py
3. Modify the example usage to test different usernames and login patterns.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python functions, calculations, and return values
- Simple data analysis for security monitoring
- Conditional alerts for anomalous behavior
